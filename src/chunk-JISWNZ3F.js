            Potsession's journey began in the heart of Tuao, where our visionary founder, Maria Santos, sought to create a dining experience that would pay homage to the rich culinary heritage of the region while embracing innovation and creativity. Born and raised in Tuao, Maria grew up surrounded by the sights, sounds, and aromas of Filipino cuisine, instilling in her a deep appreciation for the flavors that define her culture.
